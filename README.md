# Compiler project
Compilers and Virtual machines article series accompanying source code

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to have a very simple compiler and interpreter showing how things work under the hood. It is not focused on optimization, nor building a production level compiler/interpreter.
My main goal with this project is to help understand how compilation (automatons & grammars) work, and explain further details in accompanying articles.
